exercise 148. Compare the function definitions from this section
(sum, how-many, all-true, one-true) with the corresponding
function definitions from the preceding sections.
Is it better to work with data definitions that accommodate empty lists as opposed
to definitions for non-empty lists? Why? Why not?

it took me a little bit longer to understand the computing logic
to accomodate empty lists as opposed to non-empty lists but once
