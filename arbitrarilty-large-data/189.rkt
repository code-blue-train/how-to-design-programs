; Exercise 189. Here is the function search:
; Number List-of-numbers -> Boolean
(define (search n alon)
  (cond
    [(empty? alon) #false]
    [else (or (= (first alon) n)
              (search n (rest alon)))]))
; It determines whether some number occurs in a list of numbers.
; The function may have to traverse the entire list to find out that
; the number of interest isnâ€™t contained in the list.
; Develop the function search-sorted, which determines whether a
; number occurs in a sorted list of numbers.
; The function must take advantage of the fact that the list is sorted.
