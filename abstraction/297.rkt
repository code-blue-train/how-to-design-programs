; Sample problem
; Navy strategists represent fleets of ships  as rectangles 
; (the ships themselves) and circles (their weaponsâ€™ reach).
; The coverage of a fleet of ships is the combination of all these shapes.
; Design a data representation for rectangles, circles, and combinations of shapes.
; Then design a function that determines whether some point is within a shape.
